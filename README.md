# WanderWise
A full-stack all-in-one inclusive travel web platform that meets all of your travel needs.

Wanderwise hopes to address a modern issue that has grown significantly in recent decades, and certainly since the 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic: the mixture of travel anxiety and loneliness. 

Too often do friends and family differ in their respective travel needs. Some want to be forever nomadic, and others refuse to board planes. For those who may find themselves abroad with a lack of ways to mingle and communicate in foreign lands, WanderWise helps provide a simple, friendly, and safe tool to help organize your trip, gain new experiences, and meet new people all in one spot.
